        The sandwich is the food of the people. It’s hard-working, layered, and versatile. To quote Liz Lemon from 30 Rock: “All of humankind has one thing in common: the sandwich. I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich”. The sandwich is great, the sandwich is king, but it needs a companion. That perfect companion is plain ruffled chips. Sure, the Bohemians and dilettantes may try to add a side of potato salad, coleslaw, or some kind of wacky quinoa salad but in the end the sandwich must not be upstaged. The plain Ruffles provide a dry sense of humor to the sandwich. It knows its role and its dry crunch completes the sandwich as a meal. The plain ruffle chips provide those first few bites before and after the main course and never upstages. That salty crunch is crucial and can never be an afterthought.

        <h3>Be accessible but have layers</h3>
        <p>The sandwich is approachable and relatable but there is depth to each sandwich’s individual personality.</p>

        <h3>Work hard</h3>
        <p>The sandwich is not a lettuce wrap or rice bowl. It’s there to provide good honest taste and nourishment. The sandwich is a classic and is not always chasing the trends. It first goal is to be a hardworking meal. </p>

        <p>Condiments are key to a good sandwich, so find the right condiments that work for you and don’t be afraid to try new ones. A small change can make a big difference.</p>

        <h3>Find common ground</h3>

        <p>Almost every culture and region have their own particular sandwich. Whether it’s a bagel with lox and cream cheese or a banh mi the commonality is two slices of bread with something in the middle. </p>

        <h3>Don’t overthink it</h3>
        <p>If ham and cheese sandwiches work for you then stick with ham and cheese. If you’re tired of ham and cheese then switch to something else. There are a lot of sandwiches out there to explore if you want to. </p>

        <h3>You need salty chips</h3>
        <p>Preferably, plain ruffled chips. All things good require collaboration. The sandwich needs that dry, salty crunch. The sandwich as a meal is not complete without some plain ruffled chips. </p>
